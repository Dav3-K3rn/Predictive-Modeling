📖 Overview

The Predictive Modeling Demo provides a unified environment for analyzing real-world machine learning tasks, including:

Breast cancer diagnosis prediction (classification)

Diabetes progression prediction (regression)

Customer segmentation (clustering)

Each section includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Model training and evaluation

Visualization of metrics and results

Automated comparison of multiple algorithms

✨ Features

✅ End-to-end data analysis and visualization

🧩 Uses standard, reliable datasets for reproducibility

📊 Model performance comparison (accuracy, F1-score, R², etc.)

🎯 Automated plots: confusion matrix, ROC curves, regression fits, clustering visualization

🧠 Extensible for advanced techniques (e.g., SHAP interpretability)

📈 IEEE publication-ready format

📂 Datasets Used
Task	Dataset	Source
Classification	Breast Cancer Dataset	sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer()
Regression	Diabetes Dataset	sklearn.datasets.load_diabetes()
Clustering	Synthetic Customer Segmentation (make_blobs)	sklearn.datasets.make_blobs()
⚙️ Installation
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PredictiveModelingDemo.git
cd PredictiveModelingDemo

2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # on macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # on Windows

3️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


If requirements.txt is not yet created, install manually:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn shap

▶️ Usage
Run the full demo:
python "Python demo.py"


The script will:

Check Python and library versions

Load datasets automatically

Perform EDA

Train multiple models for each task

Display visual performance metrics

You will see detailed console outputs and multiple plots for:

Classification (e.g., ROC Curves, Confusion Matrix)

Regression (e.g., Predicted vs Actual, Residuals)

Clustering (e.g., True vs Predicted Clusters, Elbow Method)
